# AstroidsFinal
This is my freshman asteroids project at BYUI


![Asteroids Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41452865/66078810-fc3b4380-e51f-11e9-8119-36600a7a5e57.gif)

I was new at programming at the time, I am aware that there are many things wrong this. See drawasteroids.cpp for a good laugh. 

Yes, I did try to allocate and free 2640 floats each frame (and for each asteroid). Yes, I calculated the rotation for 2640 points each frame (again, also for each asteroid). Wait 

Why is the file so long, you ask? I wrote a program in python to create this beautiful file, by taking asteroid pngs I found online getting the rgb for each pixel and constructing this mess.
